Sensors Specialist, Avionics team
I'm currently helping to build and write the funtionality on board the cubesat
that will regulate it's internal attitude and make changes to it if needed.
Gaining exposure to the more tangibles aspects of CS as well as EE, had to learn
about interfacing, data transfer, writing drivers, and how sensors work.
