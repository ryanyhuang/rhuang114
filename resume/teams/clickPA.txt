clickPA was a website that helped high school students find nearby events
I helped build Android app for clickPA. We were a finalist in the Palo Alto
Apps Challenge. I experienced and practiced skills required to produce an app
like showcasing and pitching. I also networked with city officials, other
finalists, and Cloudera engineers.
