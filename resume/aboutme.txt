I’m currently a sophomore at UC San Diego, and I was born and raised in Palo
Alto, California. The surrounding Silicon Valley gave me plenty of exposure to
the world of Computer Science, and I’ve been hooked since I took my first
programming class in high school. Within the field of Computer Science, I’m
especially interested in data science and statistics. I was fascinated when my
sister explained how the Google maps estimated travel time was based on data
gathered from cars currently on the road, as opposed to the speed limit.

In the short term, I want to prioritize my education and classes, work on
projects, and gain some work experience. After my undergraduate, I aim to
spend some time outside of California (probably on the East Coast), and I’m
planning to attend graduate school. In the long term, I hope to have a 
stimulating job that enables me to use Computer Science to give back to the
world that's given me so much.
