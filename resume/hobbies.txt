In my free time, I like to hang out with friends, play League, go to the gym,
and watch TV. My favorite TV shows are Nathan for You, Jane the Virgin,
Silicon Valley, and Rick and Morty. I’m also a huge football fan, and I like
to watch games, throw around, and I might just be the world’s best fantasy
football player (maybe).
