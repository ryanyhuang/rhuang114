This website was inspired by some of my classes at UCSD. It helped me practice
full-stack web development, and understand how child processes run on a
server. Also good problem solving practice for implementing cd, and other
functionality like tab and up and down arrow keys. Also had to review UNIX so
I could put measures in place that prevent people from compromising the server.
