Spring 2016
This website was made with the Basement Improvement Committee, and showed
the availability of the lab computers where UCSD CSE students were expected
to work on their programming assignments. It works by ssh-ing into each
computer in the lab, and checking how many login processes are currently
running.
I designed the frontend, and integrated the backend into the current CSES
website. This was the first nodejs app that I made, and gave me a lot of
exposure to full-stack web development, as well as shell scripting and 
understanding UNIX and servers. I'm currently writing a module that will take
the data from the website and analyze it to produce useful statistics about
the lab, like when it is the most busy, and when there is the highest tutor
to student ratio. This will help UCSD CS students plan their days and increase
their productivity.
